/**
 * ''StealthNet'' connections manager.
 *
 * Peers or connections can be registered, up to the configured connection
 * limit. The manager automatically adds or removes ourself against the known
 * WebCaches, and requests peer connections, depending on the number of opened
 * (and accepted) connections:
 *   - lower limit is the configured average count
 *   - upper limit is `1.25 * average`
 *
 * The actual implementation uses actor messages to ensure thread-safety, and
 * provides methods to interact with the manager without worrying about it.
 *
 * Manager has to be `start`ed before being used, and `stop`ped before closing
 * the application.
 *
 * For each connection, workflow is:
 *   - for client-side only, before initiating connection: `addPeer`
 *     - if peer is not accepted, client does nothing
 *   - channel opening: `connection`
 *   - channel connected: `addConnection`
 *     - if connection is not accepted, the channel is closed
 *   - channel closed: `closedChannel`
 *
 * This manager delegates client connections requests to another manager
 * ([[stealthnet.scala.network.connection.StealthNetClientConnectionsManager]]).
 * Thus, when necessary a new peer connection request will be sent to the
 * client connections manager, which will return a response once a new client
 * has been instantiated.
 *
 * Stopping the application core is a bit subtle: we have to keep resources
 * available until all connections are terminated, then cleanup can be done.
 * Thus the core only notifies the manager to stop: at this point, no new
 * peer/connection is allowed; once there is no more client request ongoing
 * (which could cause race conditions), we can close all connections; once the
 * last connection is terminated we can then call back the core to shutdown.
