/**
 * ''StealthNet'' connections manager.
 *
 * Peers or connections can be registered, up to the configured connection
 * limit. The manager automatically adds or removes ourself against the known
 * WebCaches, and requests peer connections, depending on the number of opened
 * (and accepted) connections:
 *   - lower limit is the configured average count
 *   - upper limit is `1.25 * average`
 *
 * The actual implementation uses actor messages to ensure thread-safety, and
 * provides methods to interact with the manager without worrying about it.
 *
 * Manager has to be `start`ed before being used, and `stop`ped before closing
 * the application.
 *
 * For each connection, workflow is:
 *   - for client-side only, before initiating connection: `addPeer`
 *     - if peer is not accepted, client does nothing
 *   - channel opening: `getConnection` (creation mode)
 *   - channel connected: `addConnection`
 *     - if connection is not accepted, the channel is closed
 *   - channel closed: `closedChannel`
 *
 * This manager delegates client connections actions to another manager
 * ([[StealthNetClientConnectionsManager]]). This is actually necessary due to
 * the way the actor-based implementation is used (synchronous message/reply),
 * to prevent deadlocks (closing a client connection will call back the
 * connections manager).
 * Thus, when necessary a new peer connection request will be sent to the
 * client connections manager, which will return a response once a new client
 * has been instantiated. Similarly, upon receiving a channel closing message on
 * a client connection, a connection closing request will be sent to the client
 * manager, which will send back a peer removal request upon completion.
